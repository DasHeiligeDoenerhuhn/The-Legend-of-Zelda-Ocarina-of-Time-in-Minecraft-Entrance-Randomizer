# The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time-in-Minecraft-Entrance-Randomizer
This is a Entrance Randomizer for the MCMap "The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time-in-Minecraft" by Rivero.  
Ive only tested it with version 1.0.3  
This Randomizer can only Randomize Subarea entrances.  
# How-To  
Execute the .exe File and choose "Open Datapack".  
Navigate to the worldfolder/datapacks/Legend of Zelda Data/data/ocarina_of_time/functions and select teleports.  
Now press the "Randomize Entrances" Button.  
The Program will freeze for a few seconds (There is a lot going on).  
Just wait and then finally press "Export" to patch the Datapack.  
Now start your game as usual and enjoy
